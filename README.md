# Realtime-Grocery-App
In a post-COVID world, many people have come to appreciate how useful mobile apps can be to
connect them to the resources they need. Tim, who runs a local family-owned grocery store
is no exception to appreciating this convenience. Tim’s store, like many small businesses, was
negatively impacted by the pandemic and moving it online turned out to be challenging as most
companies that provide delivery and pick-up services via websites/apps prefer to deal with much
bigger establishments.

## Features and User Stories

This is a real-time Android app that allows Tim and similar grocery store owners to
conduct their business online. Based on the user research and persona analysis. we identified the following features for implementation:

1. As a store owner, I should be able to create a unique account that I can log back into so that I can
save and securely access the data that I have put up for my store.

2. As a store owner, I should be able to list each of my products, and important information about
them (such as their price and brand), on the application so that customers can gain information
about my products when they visit my store’s page.

3. As a store owner, I should be able to see all orders that customers have completed for my store
(and the content of the order) so that I can work on fulfilling them during the workday.

4. As a store owner, I should be able to mark an order as complete once it is done so that the
the customer knows that it is ready for pick-up.

5. As a customer, I should also be able to sign up and login to my own unique account (which is
different from the store owner) so that I can save and securely access all the data that I have saved
about myself.

6. As a customer, I should be able to see all of the stores that are offered on the app so that I can
see what available choices I have when it comes to creating an order.

7. As a customer, I should be able to create an order on the app so that it can be sent to the store
and completed so that I don’t have to go to the store to do it myself.

8. As a customer, I should be able to order as many items as I want in one order so that I don’t have
to keep completing a new order for each item.
